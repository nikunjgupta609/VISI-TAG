# VISI-TAG: Automated Product Attribute Prediction for E-Commerce

E-commerce platforms often struggle with inaccurate product descriptions. Sellers may input incorrect attributes, leading to customer dissatisfaction and return costs. This project aims to:
- Develop an ML model that predicts product attributes from images.
- Assist sellers in filling product details efficiently.
- Enhance the accuracy and reliability of online product catalogs.

## Introduction
**VISI-TAG** is an AI-powered solution that enhances e-commerce product cataloging by automatically predicting product attributes (such as color, pattern, and sleeve length) directly from images. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques, VISI-TAG ensures that product listings are more accurate and efficient, minimizing discrepancies between images and textual descriptions.


## Technologies Used
VISI-TAG is built using a combination of modern AI frameworks and web technologies:
   * PyTorch & Torchvision
   * ResNet18 (Pretrained CNN Model)
   * PIL & OpenCV for image processing
   * Tesseract OCR (optional for text extraction)


## Installation Guide
To set up VISI-TAG on your local system, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/VISI-TAG.git
cd VISI-TAG
```


## Evaluation Metrics
Submissions are evaluated based on:
- **Harmonic Mean of Macro & Micro F1-Score** for each attribute
- Averaging F1-scores across categories and attributes
- A strict validation system that prevents null values

## Expected Submission Format
Predictions should be submitted in the following format:
```
id, Category, len, attr_1, attr_2, ..., attr_10
1, Sarees, 10, 'same as border', 'woven design', 'big border', ..., 'no'
2, Men Tshirts, 5, 'black', 'round', 'printed', ..., 'dummy_value'
```
Ensure to fill missing attributes with **dummy_value** to avoid errors.
